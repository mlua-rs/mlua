   = help: within `[closure@$DIR/tests/compile/non_send.rs:11:25: 13:6]`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<Cell<i32>>`
   = note: required because it appears within the type `[closure@$DIR/tests/compile/non_send.rs:11:25: 13:6]`
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `mlua::types::MaybeSend` for `[closure@$DIR/tests/compile/non_send.rs:11:25: 13:6]`
